# Monty Hall problem simulator

This is a Python script that simulates the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

With each round, two goats and one car are distributed randomly behind doors.
The contestant always chooses door #1. The host will always choose
door #2 if it's a goat, otherwise door #3. The contestant will then always
choose door #2 or #3, depending on which door the host has chosen.

To play another round, hit the ENTER key. The script keeps a tally of how many
goats vs. cars the contestant has won.
